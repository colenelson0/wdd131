			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this website will be to provide a place for music enthusiasts to sell their CDs to others who are interested in adding CDs to their collections. It serves as a place for purchasing CDs secondhand, rather than directly from a seller or from a retail location like Walmart.</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The intended audience of this website is music collectors and music enthusiasts, particularly those who enjoy the high sound quality of CDs. Most CD releases are no longer in production, which means that for most people, acquiring CDs secondhand is the best option available.</p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The dynamic elements of the main page will include a search bar that will search for CDs that are currently available on the website based on the user's query. For each result that is shown, there should be an option to add that item to the user's cart. On the cart page, for each item, there should be an option to remove that item from the list. In addition, there will be a checkout button that will calculate and display the total cost of the purchase.</p>

			<p>Our story: CDrabbit was established in 2024 by web developer and part-time music producer, Cole Nelson. As the general population continues to depend more on streaming services and less on physical media, the need for preservation grows as well. Our goal is to make music CDs easier to access so that music lovers can cherish their favorite songs fear of them disappearing from streaming services.</p>
			<h3>My Cart</h3>
			<p>Simplified sign up element: [Sign up] [Login]</p>
			<p>Cart items element: [Cart items]</p>
			<p>Disclaimer: Orders containing items from more than one seller will require multiple shipping fees. Refunds on missing or damaged items must be completed by the seller. If the seller fails to take accountability for an unfulfilled order, please send us a report so that we can help resolve the dispute.</p>
			<p>Check out element: Subtotal, shipping, tax, total [Check out]</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				When a query is entered into the search bar, the featured CDs element will be hidden and a list of CDs that match the query will appear. The items will be presented in a singular column and additional information will be shown about each item, such as the release year, record label, and number of sellers.

			<h3>My Cart</h3>

				An actual check out page will not be completed for this webpage. Instead, when the user clicks the "Check out" button, the page will show a simple thank you message that informs the user that they will receive an invoice email that confirms the order has been placed.
